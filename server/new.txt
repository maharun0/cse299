Depression has been found to be prevalent among youths and influences a person’s lifestyle and\nthought process. Unfortunately, due to the public and social stigma attached to this disease, the mental health\nissue of individuals are often overlooked. Early diagnosis of patients who may have depression often helps to\nprovide effective treatment. This research aims to develop mechanisms to detect and predict depression levels\nand was applied to university students in Bangladesh. In this work, a questionnaire containing 106 questions\nhas been constructed. The questions in the questionnaire are primarily of two kinds – (i) personal, and (ii)\nclinical. The questionnaire was distributed amongst Bangladeshi students and a total of 684 responses (aged\nbetween 19 and 35) were obtained. After appropriate consents from the participants, they were allowed to\ntake the survey. After carefully scrutinizing the responses, 520 samples were taken into final consideration.\nA hybrid depression assessment scale was developed using a voting algorithm that employs eight well-known\nexisting scales to assess the depression level of an individual. This hybrid scale was then applied to the collected\nsamples that comprise personal information and questions from various familiar depression measuring scales.\nIn addition, ten machine learning and two deep learning models were applied to predict the three classes\nof depression (normal, moderate and extreme). Five hyperparameter optimizers and nine feature selection\nmethods were employed to improve the predictability. Accuracies of 98.08%, 94.23%, and 92.31% were\nobtained using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and CNN models, respectively. Random Forest accomplished\nthe lowest false negatives and highest F Measure with its optimized hyperparameters. Finally, LIME, an\nexplainable AI framework, was applied to interpret and retrace the prediction output of the machine learning\nmodels.\n1. Introduction\nDiagnosing depression is an extremely tricky and sensitive business\nin psychiatry. Depression, frequently referred to as the ‘‘common cold’’\nof psychopathology, is the most well-known psychiatric condition,\nwith a history that predates the study of psychiatry itself [ 1]. It is a\ncomplicated medical illness that affects patients to varying degrees.\nDepressed patients exhibit a variety of symptoms that may impair their\nability to think, sleep, socialize, and even carry out routine tasks.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), one in every\nfour individuals suffers from mental health disorders worldwide [ 2],\nwith over 280 million people of different ages suffering from de-\npression [ 3]. In [ 4], it has been reported that mental diseases in\nBangladeshis range from 6.5 to 31.0% among adults and 13.4 to 22.9%\namong children. A recent study claims that more than 7 million indi-\nviduals in Bangladesh, predominantly urban and metropolitan areas,\nsuffer from depression and anxiety [ 5]. Depression has been found\n∗ Corresponding author.\nE-mail address: sifat.momen@northsouth.edu (S. Momen).\nto be highly prevalent among college and university students [ 6,7].\nOne survey reported that 24% of students suffer from both anxiety\nand depression [ 8]. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a further\nrise in the number of depression cases. According to one study, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated depression among Bangladeshi\nstudents and has affected them in various ways, including increased\nsleep disorders and poor dietary habits [ 9]. The findings of these\nstudies on Bangladeshi university students are concerning and require\nappropriate action. As a step toward that, this study attempts to take\nthe first step towards understanding the primary causes of depression\namong the students studying at the tertiary level in Bangladesh and\nto build a mechanism to predict the severity of depression. A new\nscale for measuring depression levels has been developed, and machine\nlearning techniques have been utilized to tackle this issue. Identifying\ndepression at an early stage would undoubtedly prevent the situation\nfrom worsening further.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.array.2023.100291\nReceived 27 February 2023; Received in revised form 25 April 2023; Accepted 3 May 2023'
