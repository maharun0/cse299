# Hybrid Documents RAG based Chatbot

## Abstract

State-of-the-art commercial conversational models
are typically limited to public data, lacking direct access to
personal or specialized documents due to security concerns about
exposing sensitive information. To bridge this gap, the Hybrid
Documents RAG based Chatbot empowers users to securely tap
into their own document collections for personalized information
retrieval. By seamlessly combining rapid local indexing, context-
sensitive ranking, and reranking, the system enables fast, precise
searches without relying on cloud-based services. This privacy-
centric design ensures that sensitive data remains safely on-
device, while also offering online mode for accessing more compu-
tational power. Ultimately, the chatbot offers a groundbreaking
paradigm in personalized information discovery, striking an ideal
balance between performance, flexibility, and security.
